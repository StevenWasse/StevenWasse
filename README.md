# 💫 About Me
Howdy! 🤠 I’m Steven, an early-career data scientist at [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/) 🤖 cooking up solutions in predictive and generative AI 🚀. Currently leveling up with a [Masters in Analytics at Georgia Tech](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics) 🎓. My journey started in sunny California, took me to the historic University of Virginia to study [systems engineering](https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/systems-and-information-engineering) and [rowing](https://aig.alumni.virginia.edu/virginiarowing/) 🚣, and now I’m deep into developing AI-enabled technologies in St. Louis, MO 🏙️. 

Passionate about quantum computing, behavioral economics, and biomimetic design 🌟. If you’re into data, machine learning, or just cool tech, let’s connect! 🔥

# 🕺 Quote of the Day
<i>"It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. <b>The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood,</b> who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, <b>if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat."</b></i> <br>- Theodore Roosevelt, Speech at the Sorbonne, Paris, April 23, 1910
